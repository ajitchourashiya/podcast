We propose a system which automatically generate audio summaries for podcasts, allowing listeners to quickly preview podcast episodes. The proposed system first transcribes the audio from a podcast using automatic speech recognition (ASR), then summarizes the transcript using extractive text summarization, and finally returns the audio associated with the text summary. Motivated by a lack of relevant datasets for this task, After transcription, the text is processed through natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to extract the most important points, key topics, and relevant information from the podcast. Podcast Transcription and Summarization with Speech Synthesis‚Äù is a comprehensive exploration into the technologies that enable automatic transcription, summarization.

There are three main approaches to speech synthesis: formant synthesis, articulatory synthesis, 
and concatenative synthesis. Formant synthesis models the frequencies of speech signal. 
Formants are the resonance frequencies of the vocal tract. The speech is synthesized using 
these estimated frequencies. Articulatory synthesis generates speech by direct modeling of 
human articulator behavior. Text summarization is a part of computational linguistics and 
computer science with the aim being to compress a longer text into a shorter one, where both 
the input and output lengths are variables of the model. The summarized text has to have multiple 
attributes to be considered a good summary such as containing no redundant information, being written 
in good language, being concise and most importantly containing all the important information from the
source text that is being summarized
